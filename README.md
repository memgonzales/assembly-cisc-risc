# Assembly Programming Exercises

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Assembly-blue.svg)

This project is an assortment of programming exercises in assembly, taken from course outputs in an assembly programming class under Mr. Roger Luis T. Uy of the Department of Computer Technology, De La Salle University. 

Representative source codes (with detailed comments) are provided for the following topics:
- [x86 Assembly Programming](https://github.com/memgonzales/assembly-x86-risc/blob/master/%5Bx86%5D%20Armstrong%20Number.asm)
- [x86-to-C Interfacing](https://github.com/memgonzales/assembly-x86-risc/blob/master/%5Bx86%20to%20C%5D%20Normalization.asm)
- [RISC-V Assembly Programming](https://github.com/memgonzales/assembly-x86-risc/blob/master/%5BRISC-V%5D%20Maclaurin%20Series%20-%20Cosine.asm)

## Built Using
The source codes for x86 assembly programming and x86-to-C interfacing were written with [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) as the assembler. For cross-platform input/output, the macro library [`io.inc`](https://github.com/Dman95/SASM/blob/master/BSD/share/sasm/include/io.inc) &mdash; provided by [SASM](https://dman95.github.io/SASM/english.html) &mdash; was used.

The source code for RISC-V assembly programming was written with [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars) as the assembler and simulator.
